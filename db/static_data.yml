You will become solid enough for Michael to perceive you when you learn to want Someone Else besides Michael. I don\xE2\x80\x99t say \xE2\x80\x98more than Michael\xE2\x80\x99, not as a beginning. That will come later. It\xE2\x80\x99s only the little germ of a desire for God that we need to start the process.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CYou wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t talk like that if you were a mother.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CYou mean, if I were only a mother. But there is no such thing as being only a mother. You exist as Michael\xE2\x80\x99s mother only because you first existed as God\xE2\x80\x99s creature. That relation is older and closer. No, listen, Pam! He also loves. He also has suffered. He also has waited a long time.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CThis is all nonsense\xE2\x80\x94cruel and wicked nonsense. What right have you to say things like that about Mother-love? It is the highest and holiest feeling in human nature.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CPam, Pam\xE2\x80\x94no natural feelings are high or low, holy or unholy, in themselves. They are all holy when God\xE2\x80\x99s hand is on the rein. They all go bad when they set up on their own and make themselves into false gods.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t care about all your rules and regulations. I don\xE2\x80\x99t believe in a God who keeps mother and son apart. I believe in a God of love. No one had a right to come between me and my son. Not even God. Tell Him that to His face. I want my boy, and I mean to have him. He is mine, do you understand? Mine, mine, mine, for ever and ever.\xE2\x80\x9D"

Lewis's book _The Great Divorce_, and it is really good.  You're obviously taking on a pretty substantial challenge to take a theological and imaginative and literary work like _The Great Divorce_ and try to turn it into a concept record, and maybe it's a little bit 70's of me to be attracted to that kind of music.  But if you like progressive rock, this is of the lighter variety.  [It's] very eclectic--a lot of different kinds of songs, a lot of different kinds of instruments.  The songs really do capture the characters and the chapters and the feel of Lewis's book...and you will like it even if you don't like C.S. Lewis's _The Great Divorce_.\"\r\n\

        \r\n\
        I saw coming towards us a Ghost who carried on his shoulder was a little red lizard, and it was twitching its tail like a whip and whispering things in his ear. As we caught sight of him he turned his head to the reptile with a snarl of impatience. \xE2\x80\x9CShut up, I tell you!\xE2\x80\x9D he said. It wagged its tail and continued to whisper to him. He ceased snarling, and presently began to smile. Then he turned and started to limp westward, away from the mountains. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9COff so soon?\xE2\x80\x9D said a voice. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CYes. I\xE2\x80\x99m off,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Ghost. \xE2\x80\x9CThanks for all your hospitality. But it\xE2\x80\x99s no good, you see. I told this little chap\xE2\x80\x9D (here he indicated the Lizard) \xE2\x80\x9Cthat he\xE2\x80\x99d have to be quiet if he came\xE2\x80\x94which he insisted on doing. Of course his stuff won\xE2\x80\x99t do here: I realise that. But he won\xE2\x80\x99t stop. I shall just have to go home.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CWould you like me to make him quiet?\xE2\x80\x9D said the flaming Spirit\xE2\x80\x94an angel, as I now understood. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9COf course I would,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Ghost. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CThen I shall kill him,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Angel, taking a step forward. \xE2\x80\x9CHave I your permission?\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CI know it will kill me.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CIt won\xE2\x80\x99t. But supposing it did?\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re right. It would be better to be dead that to live with this creature.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        Next moment the Ghost gave a scream of agony such as I never heard on Earth. The Burning One closed his crimson grip on the reptile: twisted it, while it bit and writhed, and then flung it, broke-backed on the turf. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        Part II \r\n\
        \r\n\
        At first I thought the operation had failed. So far from dying, the creature was still struggling and even growing bigger as it struggled. And as it grew it changed. Its hinder parts grew rounder. The tail, still flickering, became a tail of hair that flickered between huge and glossy buttocks. Suddenly I started back, rubbing my eyes. What stood before me was the greatest stallion I have ever seen, silvery white but with mane and tail of gold. It was smooth and shining, rippled with swells of flesh and muscle, whinnying and stamping with its hoofs. At each stamp the land shook and the trees dindled. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        The new-made man turned and clapped the new horse\xE2\x80\x99s neck. It nosed his bright body. Horse and master breathed each into the other\xE2\x80\x99s nostrils. The man turned from it, flung himself at the feet of the Burning One, and embraced them. In joyous haste the young man leaped upon the horse\xE2\x80\x99s back. Turning in his eat he waved farewell, then nudged the stallion with his heels. They were off before I knew well what was happening. There was riding if you like! I came out as quickly as I could from among the bushes to follow them with my eyes; but already they were only like a shooting star far off on the green plain, and soon among the foothills of the mountains. Then, still like a star, I saw them winding up, scaling what seemed impossible steeps, and quicker every moment, till near the dim brow of the landscape, so high that I must strain my neck to see them, they vanished, bright themselves, into the rose-brightness of that everlasting morning.

      content: "\xE2\x80\x9CEven supposing a man of unholy life were suffered to enter heaven, he would not be happy there; so that it would be no mercy to permit him to enter.\xE2\x80\x9D C.S. Lewis\xE2\x80\x99s work _The Great Divorce_ is something of an extended narrative reflection on these words by John Henry Cardinal Newman.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        The story is told by a Narrator we come to know as a characterization of Lewis himself. At the opening, he finds himself in a seemingly endless, dreary town hazily draped in a \xE2\x80\x9Cgreasy rain.\xE2\x80\x9D Locals are gathering at a bus stop, and the Narrator boards with them. The bus travels (aerially) to a strikingly different locale, \xE2\x80\x9Ca level, grassy country through which there ran a wide river\xE2\x80\x9D with mountains visible in the distance. When Lewis disembarks, he finds discovers that the grass is sharp on his feet and that his body is translucent: he and his company from the Grey Town appear insubstantial, ghost-like, compared with the firmer reality of the heavenly country.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        The narrative progresses as a series of dialogues the Narrator either observes or participates in. The interlocutors are ghosts form the Grey Town and spirits from the heavenly country. The ghosts find the new environment and its inhabitants frightening, disturbing, even offensive. Few stay.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        The story contains obvious parallels to Dante\xE2\x80\x99s _The Divine Comedy_: the disoriented opening in medias res, the ascent from infernal to celestial locales, the presence of a teacher or guide, reference to purgative processes, notions of the alteration of memory of evil (\xC3\xA0 la the river Lethe), and even explicit reference to Beatrice. And like Dante\xE2\x80\x99s work, _The Great Divorce_ poses a difficult exegetical problem: to what extent is it meant as a theology of the afterlife, and to what extent is it a reflection on the depths and heights of life as we know it?\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Clearly, there is an eschatological message in _The Great Divorce_: hell is chosen by its inhabitants. But Lewis stops short of saying much else about the details of the afterlife. The abrupt ending tells us that the journey has all been an allegorical dream, after all. In the final counting, the narrative focuses not on abstractions about postmortem survival, but on the unique individuals encountered by the Narrator\xE2\x80\x94their \xE2\x80\x9Cfight against joy\xE2\x80\x9D or their embrace of it, their acceptance or rejection of grace. The work\xE2\x80\x99s power is in its illuminating religious psychology. Countless good reasons there may be for modern and postmodern people to eschew traditional religious devotion. This story is all about the bad reasons.\r\n\

        \r\n\
        My friends, \xE2\x80\x99tis clearly a priori\r\n\
        That cultures espouse a meta-story\r\n\
        A veritable intellectual quarry\r\n\
        \r\n\
        From which they draw their sense of shame,\r\n\
        Their paradigmatic value claims,\r\n\
        And their institutes of praise and blame.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        But we, the academic heroes, rise\r\n\
        Above their existential cries\r\n\
        For we need no answers to be wise:\r\n\
        \r\n\
        For wisdom lies neither in value nor fact,\r\n\
        But in modesty, honesty, courage, and tact\r\n\
        And in confessing what our academies have lacked,\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Their myopic, close-minded approach to thought,\r\n\
        All the unnecessary battles they\xE2\x80\x99ve fought,\r\n\
        And their delightfully one-sided concept of God.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        So, tirelessly toil we, on their behalf\r\n\
        And rejoice in the day when they give even half\r\n\
        Of the heart we so nobly put into our craft.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        And together we\xE2\x80\x99ll stand, amidst a whole host\r\n\
        Of trivial drivel, and raise high a toast\r\n\
        To the death of the things that matter the most."

Then, on the left and right, at each side of the forest avenue, came youthful shapes, boys upon one hand, and girls upon the other. If I could remember their singing and write down the notes, no man who read that score would ever grow sick or old. Between them went musicians: and after these a lady in whose honour all this was being done. \r\n\

        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CNot at all,\xE2\x80\x9D said my neighbor. \xE2\x80\x9CThe trouble is that they\xE2\x80\x99re so quarrelsome. As soon as anyone arrives he settles in some street. Before he\xE2\x80\x99s been there twenty-four hours he quarrels with his neighbour. Before the week is over he\xE2\x80\x99s quarreled so badly that he decides to move. Very likely he finds the next street empty because all the people there have quarreled with their neighbours\xE2\x80\x94and moved. If so he settles in. If by any chance the street is full, he goes further. But even if he stays, it makes no odds. He\xE2\x80\x99s sure to have another quarrel pretty soon and then he\xE2\x80\x99ll move on again. Finally he\xE2\x80\x99ll move right out to the edge of the town and build a new house. You see, it\xE2\x80\x99s easy here. You\xE2\x80\x99ve only got to think a house and there it is. That\xE2\x80\x99s how the town keeps on growing.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\

        \xE2\x80\x9CYou became rather narrow-minded towards the end of your life: but no doubt you\xE2\x80\x99ve broadened out again. Why, my dear boy, you were coming to believe in a literal Heaven and Hell!\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\

        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CAh, I see, You mean that the grey town with its continual hope of morning (we must all live by hope, must we not?), with its field for indefinite progress, is, in some sense, Heaven, if only we have eyes to see it? That is a beautiful idea.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t mean that at all. Is it possible you don\xE2\x80\x99t know where you\xE2\x80\x99ve been?\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\

      content: "Phil Woodward, songwriter and the creative force behind <i>Ghosts and Spirits</i>, grew up in Seattle, Washington. He was trained as a vocalist and composer, having studied music in the Northwest Boychoir and at Seattle Pacific University. He has been writing and arranging music ever since he can remember. In 2001, Phil formed Phileas Fogg. The band released a demo and an \"EP\":http://cdbaby.com/cd/phileasfogg during their time together.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Phil\xE2\x80\x99s music strikes an uncommon blend of harmonic complexity, poetic/philosophical lyrics, and emotional expressiveness. It has been described as transporting, reflective, multi-layered, subtle, and dynamic. Among his influences, Phil lists \"Sufjan Stevens\":http://asthmatickitty.com/musicians.php?artistID=5, \"Radiohead\":http://www.radiohead.com, \"Coldplay\":http://www.coldplay.com/, \"Death Cab for Cutie\":http://www.deathcabforcutie.com/, \"Suzanne Vega\":http://www.suzannevega.com/, and \"Sigur R\xC3\xB3s\":http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        In 2004, Phil began to write songs for a concept album based on C.S. Lewis's work <i>The Great Divorce</i>. The final product, <i>Ghosts and Spirits</i>, took the better part of three years to complete. The band began to disperse in the midst of the project\xE2\x80\x94Myron Marston to China, Mark Noguchi to Los Angeles. While the project was clearly collaborative (with extensive help from the remaining Phileas Fogg members Chris Kennedy and Bobby Jacky, among many others), it became clear that it would outlive the band. Phil released the album under his own name.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        In 2006, Phil married Seattle singer/songwriter \"Lacey Brown\":http://www.laceybrown.com/. He is now pursuing a PhD in Philosophy at Indiana University.\r\n"

Presently we glided over that top: we were flying above a level, grassy country through which there ran a wide river. We were losing height now: some of the tallest tree tops were only twenty feet below us. Then, suddenly we were at rest. Everyone had jumped up. Curses, taunts, blows, a filth of vituperation, came to my ears as my fellow-passengers struggled to get out. A moment later, and they had all succeeded. I was alone in the bus, and through the open door there came to me in the fresh stillness the singing of a lark. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        At first, of course, my attention was caught by my fellow-passengers, who were still grouped about in the neighborhood of the omnibus, though beginning, some of them, to walk forward into the landscape with hesitating steps. I gasped when I saw them. Now that they were in the light, they were transparent\xE2\x80\x94fully transparent when they stood between me and it, smudgy and imperfectly opaque when they stood in the shadow of some tree. They were in fact ghosts: man-shaped stains on the brightness of that air. One could attend to them or ignore them at will as you do with the dirt on a window pane. I noticed that the grass did not bend under their feet: even the dew drops were not disturbed. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        Then some re-adjustment of the mind or some focusing of my eyes took place, and I saw the whole phenomenon the other way round. The men were as they had always been; as all the men I had known had been perhaps. It was the light, the grass, the trees that were different; made of some different substance, so much solider than things in our country that men were ghosts by comparison. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CI don\xE2\x80\x99t like it! I don\xE2\x80\x99t like it,\xE2\x80\x9D screamed a voice. \xE2\x80\x9CIt gives me the pip!\xE2\x80\x9D One of the ghosts had darted past me, back into the bus. She never came out of it again as far as I know. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        The others remained, uncertain. "

        Here nothing ever changes\r\n\
        It\xE2\x80\x99s been the same for ages\r\n\
        We hope you all enjoy your stay\r\n\
        No need for reservations\r\n\
        If you desire accommodations\r\n\
        Just dream them up: they\xE2\x80\x99re yours for free\r\n\
        Feel free to settle near here\r\n\
        But we doubt you will, \xE2\x80\x99cause we\xE2\x80\x99re here\r\n\
        We suspect you\xE2\x80\x99ll want your privacy\r\n\
        \r\n\
        _If you open your eyes, you\xE2\x80\x99ll see it\xE2\x80\x99s heaven_\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Sure, it\xE2\x80\x99s always raining\r\n\
        And everyone\xE2\x80\x99s complaining\r\n\
        But some you win, and some you lose\r\n\
        If you ever need a handful\r\n\
        Of something insubstantial\r\n\
        You can have anything you choose\r\n\
        It\xE2\x80\x99s not that wounds are healing\r\n\
        It\xE2\x80\x99s more that we\xE2\x80\x99ve stopped feeling\r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x99Cause pain and pleasure we\xE2\x80\x99ve outgrown\r\n\
        No need to fear disasters\r\n\
        In a town where nothing matters\r\n\
        So come and make yourself at home\r\n\
        \r\n\
        _If you open your eyes, you\xE2\x80\x99ll see it\xE2\x80\x99s heaven_\r\n\
        \r\n\
        If your neighbor has abused you\r\n\
        It\xE2\x80\x99s not something to get used to\r\n\
        Go to the center of the city\r\n\
        Take it to the complaint committee\r\n\
        If they like the way it sounds, you\xE2\x80\x99ll\r\n\
        Get referred to the higher council\r\n\
        First, have a chat with the chief official\r\n\
        (An imposing individual)\r\n\
        And if it\xE2\x80\x99s enough you\xE2\x80\x99ve paid her\r\n\
        You will hear back six weeks later\r\n\
        Their decision will take affect when\r\n\
        They complete the triannual inspection\r\n\
        But if you want to skip that process,\r\n\
        Let it go, and cut your losses\r\n\
        The solution\xE2\x80\x99s rather simple:\r\n\
        Move to where there\xE2\x80\x99s no more people\r\n\
        \r\n\
        _If you open your eyes, you\xE2\x80\x99ll see it\xE2\x80\x99s heaven_"

        I watched in wonder as the world\xE2\x80\x99s walls opened\r\n\
        And my vision all was changed\r\n\
        Description, via words and sounds and colors\r\n\
        All this glory and grace defy\r\n\
        Still I offer these, my feeble, frail phrases\r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x99Cause I cannot help but try\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        I watched as she walked through her yard in\r\n\
        The rain and wind of an autumn afternoon\r\n\
        She tended her little garden\r\n\
        Fending off the coming of the winter\xE2\x80\x99s gloom\r\n\
        \r\n\
        I watched as the birds came and nested\r\n\
        In the trees that she pruned and prepared for them\r\n\
        And raccoons and dogs and cats all rested\r\n\
        Under her eye as she fed and cared for them\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        I watched as the neighborhood children\r\n\
        Found in her the warmth that money never buys\r\n\
        When they cried, she rocked and gently stilled them\r\n\
        When they laughed, the twinkle came into her eyes\r\n\
        \r\n\
        On her watch, the bullies left their taunting\r\n\
        And the timid learned to make new friends with ease\r\n\
        When she sent them off, they went home wanting\r\n\
        To share this love and grace with their families\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        O, how she weeded out\r\n\
        The lies that they\xE2\x80\x99d been told\r\n\
        And warmed their hearts before they could grow cold\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        I watched as the girls became women\r\n\
        And the men moved on from their boyhood glow\r\n\
        Still they came and poured out for a minute\r\n\
        All the pains and pleasures they had come to know\r\n\
        \r\n\
        There were tensions now, and broken friendships\r\n\
        Party lines and dogmas over which they fought\r\n\
        Under her roof, they\xE2\x80\x99d start to mend rifts\r\n\
        And find the sweet simplicity they always sought\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        O, how she called to mind\r\n\
        Their long-forgotten goals\r\n\
        And when she spoke, she spoke into their souls\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        Then all exploded into rapture\r\n\
        And I saw the splendor of this mighty queen\r\n\
        The darkness cowered at her laughter\r\n\
        And her tears could shake all of the world unseen\r\n\
        \r\n\
        All evil spells and incantations\r\n\
        Her simple love, they couldn\xE2\x80\x99t penetrate\r\n\
        Her joy that rippled through the nations\r\n\
        Brought low the proud, and made the crooked straight\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        O, how each creature came\r\n\
        To know its place as such\r\n\
        Through the patient power of her touch\r\n\
        \r\n\
        O, how her quiet voice\r\n\
        As angels sang along\r\n\
        Summoned every silent stone to song\r\n\
        \r\n\
        O, how she beckons us\r\n\
        To discover all we\xE2\x80\x99re worth\r\n\
        And she calls to life the dead things of the earth\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        I saw it only for a single split-second\r\n\

        I hate you and I love you, you filthy beast\r\n\
        I pushed you and I shoved you, but your powers increased\r\n\
        You sort out the enigma of how Adam fell\r\n\
        And I bear you as a stigma, my scarlet L\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Sometimes I can defy you and make you behave\r\n\
        Sometimes I justify you and become your slave\r\n\
        I feel you on my shoulder, tugging on my sleeve\r\n\
        Maybe someday when I\xE2\x80\x99m older you\xE2\x80\x99ll take your leave\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \r\n\
        Thinking you a portent of recompense\r\n\
        I followed you to torment and lost innocence\r\n\
        But when I finally vowed further filth would cease\r\n\
        Your proddings just grew louder and you cursed my peace\r\n\
        \r\n\
        So I conspired to kill you with a single attack\r\n\
        But my weapons barely stilled you, and sank into my back\r\n\
        Far from this procedure avenging my shame\r\n\
        It left my every feature bloodied and maimed\r\n\

        \r\n\
        How thin and weak you look\r\n\
        You bear a heavy yoke\r\n\
        Could it be that I mistook\r\n\
        A child for a rogue\r\n\
        If you were made to grow\r\n\
        I wonder what you\xE2\x80\x99d be\r\n\

        Overrun us that, overrun, we may share your wealth\r\n\
        Destroy the thrones and altar-stones we build for our own pride\r\n\
        Bend our backs and break our bones, that we may learn to fly"

        But they can\xE2\x80\x99t manipulate me\r\n\
        They want to me to soar to new spiritual heights\r\n\
        And forget what I\xE2\x80\x99ve always believed\r\n\
        But I\xE2\x80\x99ve always created my own happiness\r\n\
        I\xE2\x80\x99ve never been one to have faith\r\n\
        That life can be fuller and deeper than this\r\n\
        I know it\xE2\x80\x99s not true but it\xE2\x80\x99s safe\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Everyone here thinks they\xE2\x80\x99re better than me\r\n\
        I\xE2\x80\x99m sick of their mocking disdain\r\n\
        These bastards pretend they can cure my disease\r\n\
        But they don\xE2\x80\x99t\xE2\x80\x94and they can\xE2\x80\x99t\xE2\x80\x94feel my pain\r\n\
        Forgive my disinterest in \xE2\x80\x9Ccoming alive\xE2\x80\x9D:\r\n\
        I\xE2\x80\x99ll opt for my comforting grave\r\n\
        Clutching the darkness, I\xE2\x80\x99ve always survived\r\n\
        I know it\xE2\x80\x99s not good, but it\xE2\x80\x99s safe"

        \xE2\x80\x9CMy name is George,\xE2\x80\x9D he answered. \xE2\x80\x9CGeorge MacDonald.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9COh!\xE2\x80\x9D I cried. \xE2\x80\x9CThen you can tell me! You at least will not deceive me.\xE2\x80\x9D Then, supposing that these expressions of confidence needed some explanation, I tried, trembling to tell this man all that his writings had done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when I first bought a copy of Phantastes (being then about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante: Here begins the New Life\xE2\x80\xA6. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CYe had started,\xE2\x80\x9D said my Teacher, \xE2\x80\x9Cto talk of something more profitable.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CSir,\xE2\x80\x9D said I, \xE2\x80\x9CI had almost forgotten it, and I have no anxiety about the answer now, though I have still a curiosity. It is about these Ghosts. Do any of them stay? Can they stay? Is any real choice offered to them? How do they come to be here?\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CDid ye never hear of the Refrigerium? It means that the damned have holidays\xE2\x80\x94excursions, ye understand.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CBut if they come here they can really stay?\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CAye. Ye\xE2\x80\x99ll have heard that the emperor Trajan did.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CBut what of the poor Ghosts who never get into the omnibus at all?\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CEveryone who wishes it does. Never fear. There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \xE2\x80\x98Thy will be done,\xE2\x80\x99 and those to whom God says, \xE2\x80\x98Thy will be done.\xE2\x80\x99 All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it.\xE2\x80\x9D "

        \xE2\x80\x9CLooking comes first.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do you mean?\xE2\x80\x9D said the Ghost. \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CWhen you painted on earth\xE2\x80\x94at least in your earlier days\xE2\x80\x94it was because you caught glimpses of Heaven in the earthly landscape. The success of your painting was that it enabled others to see the glimpses too. But here you are having the thing itself. It is from here that the messages came. There is no good telling us about this country, for we see it already. In fact we see it better than you do. If you are interested in the country only for the sake of painting it, you\xE2\x80\x99ll never learn to see the country.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CBut that\xE2\x80\x99s just how a real artist is interested in the country.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9CNo. You\xE2\x80\x99re forgetting,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Spirit. \xE2\x80\x9CThat was not how you began. Light itself was your first love: you loved paint only as a means of telling about light.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9COh, that\xE2\x80\x99s ages ago,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Ghost. \xE2\x80\x9COne grows out of that. Of course, you haven\xE2\x80\x99t seen my later works. One becomes more and more interested in paint for its own sake.\xE2\x80\x9D \r\n\
        \r\n\
        \xE2\x80\x9COne does, indeed. I also have had to recover from that. It was all a snare. Ink and catgut and paint were necessary down there, but they are also dangerous stimulants. Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him.\xE2\x80\x9D "

      content: "_Ghosts and Spirits_ is a concept album by Phil Woodward based on C.S. Lewis\xE2\x80\x99s classic text, _The Great Divorce_. It was released in August 2007.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Woodward\xE2\x80\x99s lyrics for _Ghosts and Spirits_ predominantly consist of first-person ruminations, from the perspective of the various characters the narrator encounters in the story. It has been pointed out that Lewis, eager to depict the deep immaturity of his characters, tends to portray them as somewhat ridiculous; Woodward is able to humanize them, despite their perversity. His lyrical style, reminiscent of Sufjan Stevens, is philosophical yet playful, tender but often dark.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        Musically, the album ranges widely, from the austere intimacy of \xE2\x80\x9C(Only) A Mother\xE2\x80\x9D, to the epic prog-rock-esque development of \xE2\x80\x9CThe Lizard and the Stallion\xE2\x80\x9D, to the bitterly playful folk/pop of \xE2\x80\x9CSafety\xE2\x80\x9D. The sophisticated lead guitar stylings of Myron Marston\xE2\x80\x94a long-time musical collaborator of Woodward\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x94color the album throughout.\r\n\
        \r\n\
        _Ghosts and Spirits_ was mixed and mastered by Mark Clem at \"Soul Kitchen Studios\":http://www.soulkitchenstudios.com/.  Album artwork was designed by Chuck Potrykus. \r\n\
